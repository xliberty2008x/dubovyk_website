## Professional Summary
I am an AI Engineer and AI Solutions Architect at Big Sister AI with extensive experience in designing, developing, and deploying advanced AI systems and large language model (LLM) applications. I specialize in bridging the gap between cutting-edge AI research and production-level solutions, ensuring that prototypes mature into scalable, efficient, and reliable systems.

My technical expertise covers the entire lifecycle of AI solutions. I excel in prompt engineering—applying chain-of-thought, few-shot, zero-shot, role-based, and context-based techniques—to create effective, efficient prompts that drive performance. I also possess strong skills in Python, JSON, Markdown, and Jinja, which are integral to building consistent outputs and templated reporting.

These tools support my work in both the rapid prototyping of LLM applications and the rigorous demands of production environments, where I focus on optimizing search pipelines, monitoring KPIs, and establishing scalable inference servers.

I have a solid background in data engineering and cloud infrastructure, having built automated workflows for data ingestion, transformation, and storage using platforms such as Azure and Google Cloud. My experience with CI/CD practices, including Azure DevOps and Terraform, ensures smooth integration and deployment of AI solutions. I have also implemented robust strategies, such as staging and MERGE queries in BigQuery, to maintain data quality and handle large-scale data operations efficiently.

Adapting to emerging technologies, I integrate no-code and low-code platforms like n8n for building AI agentic workflows and enabling custom data transformations. I continually update my skill set by exploring frameworks such as LangChain and advanced AI models like GPT-4 and Whisper. This diverse expertise allows me to develop systems that transform complex data into actionable insights, driving operational efficiency and strategic growth.

My focus is on delivering intelligent, scalable solutions that empower organizations to innovate and excel in today's rapidly evolving technological landscape.
