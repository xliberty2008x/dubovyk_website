# AI Assistant Framework Research

## Model Context Protocol (MCP)

### Overview
The Model Context Protocol (MCP) is a standardized approach for enabling tool calling capabilities in large language models (LLMs). It provides a structured way for LLMs to interact with external tools and services, making it easier to build AI agents that can perform actions in the real world.

### Key Features
- Standardized interface for tool definitions
- Protocol for requesting tool execution
- Mechanism for handling tool responses
- Support for multiple LLM providers

### Implementation Approach
1. Define a set of tools with clear schemas
2. Create a server that can handle tool execution requests
3. Implement adapters for different LLM providers
4. Establish a context management system

## LLM-Agnostic Design

### Requirements
- Support for OpenAI (primary)
- Support for Azure OpenAI (primary)
- Support for Google Vertex AI (secondary)
- Configurable via environment variables
- Consistent interface regardless of provider

### Provider Comparison

| Feature | OpenAI | Azure OpenAI | Google Vertex AI |
|---------|--------|-------------|-----------------|
| Tool Calling | Native support | Native support | Limited support |
| Function Calling | Yes | Yes | Partial |
| Context Window | Large | Large | Varies by model |
| Pricing | Per-token | Per-token | Per-token |
| Deployment | Cloud API | Azure resources | GCP resources |

### Implementation Strategy
1. Create abstraction layer for LLM providers
2. Implement provider-specific adapters
3. Use factory pattern for provider selection
4. Configure via environment variables

## Pipedream Integration

### Overview
Pipedream provides a platform for connecting APIs and building workflows. It can be used to extend the AI assistant's capabilities by connecting to external services.

### Integration Points
1. Use Pipedream as a tool provider for the AI assistant
2. Register Pipedream workflows as tools in the MCP server
3. Implement authentication and authorization
4. Create a UI for managing Pipedream integrations

## Admin Panel Requirements

### Features
1. Tool management (add, remove, configure)
2. Pipedream workflow integration
3. LLM provider configuration
4. Knowledge base management
5. Usage statistics and monitoring

### Implementation Approach
1. Create a protected admin route in Next.js
2. Implement authentication for admin access
3. Build UI components for managing tools and configurations
4. Connect to backend APIs for configuration management

## Knowledge Base Design

### Structure
1. Core information about Kyrylo Dubovyk
2. Professional experience and skills
3. Projects and achievements
4. FAQs and common queries

### Implementation
1. Store knowledge in structured format (JSON/YAML)
2. Implement retrieval mechanisms
3. Create context augmentation for LLM prompts
4. Allow for knowledge base updates via admin panel

## Next Steps
1. Implement basic MCP server
2. Create LLM provider abstraction layer
3. Build initial AI assistant chat interface
4. Integrate with knowledge base
5. Develop admin panel prototype
